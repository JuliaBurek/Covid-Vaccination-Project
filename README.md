# Covid-Vaccination-Project
For Node class through Forge, my partner and I created a project on Covid Vaccination data. We created some world maps and plots to see what countries were doing the best in their vaccination efforts. We used a time-series machine learning model in Python to predict when a majority of the United Statesâ€™ population would be fully vaccinated.
